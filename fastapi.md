### **üîπResponse (JSON):**

```
{
  "message": "Video summarized successfully",
  "summary": "Here's a concise summary of the transcript in bullet points:\n\n**Introduction to C++**\n\n* C++ is a statically typed, compiled programming language with a steep learning curve.\n* It was created in 1979 by Bjarne Stroustrup at AT&T Bell Labs.\n* C++ is designed as an extension of C, adding object-oriented features.\n\n**Features of C++**\n\n* Supports object-oriented programming with classes, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance.\n* Provides low-level memory and hardware control like C, but with high-level abstractions.\n* Makes it harder to shoot yourself in the foot, but more severe when errors occur.\n\n**Getting Started with C++**\n\n* Install a C++ compiler like GCC or Clang.\n* Create a file ending in .cpp and include the iostream library for input/output.\n* Use the main function to start executing code.\n\n**Basic C++ Programming**\n\n* Use standard character output to print \"Hello, World!\".\n* Create a string variable as an array of characters or use the string type from the standard library.\n* Define attributes and methods in a class, which can be private or public.\n\n**Object-Oriented Programming in C++**\n\n* Define classes with attributes and methods.\n* Use constructors and destructors to run code when an object is created or destroyed.\n* Support inheritance to share logic throughout a program.\n* Use polymorphism with method overloading.\n\n**Memory Management in C++**\n\n* Use pointers and references to manage memory manually.\n* Use tools like unique pointers to manage memory in a safer and easier way.\n\n**Compiling and Running C++ Code**\n\n* Open a terminal and use a tool like Clang++ to compile the code.\n* Run the compiled code to execute the program."
