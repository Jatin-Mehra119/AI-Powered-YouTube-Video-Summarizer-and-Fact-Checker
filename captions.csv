00:00:00,python  a  highlevel  interpreted
00:00:02,programming  language  famous  for  its
00:00:04,zen-like  code  it's  arguably  the  most
00:00:06,popular  language  in  the  world  because
00:00:08,it's  easy  to  learn  yet  practical  for
00:00:10,serious  projects  in  fact  you're  watching
00:00:12,this  YouTube  video  in  a  python  web
00:00:14,application  right  now  it  was  created  by
00:00:16,Guido  van  rossom  and  released  in  1991
00:00:19,who  named  it  after  Monty  Python's  Flying
00:00:21,Circus  which  is  why  you'll  sometimes
00:00:22,find  spaming  eggs  instead  of  Foo  and  bar
00:00:25,and  code  samples  it's  commonly  used  to
00:00:27,build  serers  side  applications  like  web
00:00:29,apps  with  the  framework  and  is  the
00:00:31,language  of  choice  for  Big  Data  analysis
00:00:33,and  machine  learning  many  students
00:00:35,choose  python  to  start  learning  decode
00:00:37,because  of  its  emphasis  on  readability
00:00:39,as  outlined  by  the  Zen  of  python
00:00:41,beautiful  is  better  than  ugly  while
00:00:43,explicit  is  better  than  implicit  python
00:00:45,is  very  simple  but  avoids  the  temptation
00:00:47,to  sprinkle  in  Magic  that  causes
00:00:49,ambiguity  its  code  is  often  organized
00:00:51,into  notebooks  where  individual  cells
00:00:53,can  be  executed  then  documented  in  the
00:00:55,same  place  we're  currently  at  version
00:00:57,three  of  the  language  and  you  can  get
00:00:58,started  by  creating  a  file  that  ends  in
00:01:01,py  or  iynb  to  create  an  interactive
00:01:04,notebook  create  a  variable  by  setting  a
00:01:06,name  equal  to  a  value  it's  strongly
00:01:08,typed  which  means  values  won't  change  in
00:01:10,unexpected  ways  but  Dynamic  so  type
00:01:12,annotations  are  not  required  the  syntax
00:01:14,is  highly  efficient  allowing  you  to
00:01:16,declare  multiple  variables  on  a  single
00:01:17,line  and  Define  tupal  lists  and
00:01:20,dictionaries  with  a  literal  syntax
00:01:22,semicolons  are  not  required  and  if  you
00:01:23,use  them  and  experience  pythonista  will
00:01:26,say  that  your  code  is  not  pythonic
00:01:27,instead  of  semicolons  python  uses
00:01:30,indentation  to  terminate  or  determine
00:01:32,the  scope  of  a  line  of  code  Define  a
00:01:34,function  with  the  def  keyword  then
00:01:35,indent  the  next  line  usually  by  four
00:01:37,spaces  to  define  the  function  body  we
00:01:39,might  then  add  a  for  Loop  to  it  and
00:01:41,indent  that  by  another  four  spaces  this
00:01:43,eliminates  the  need  for  curly  braces  and
00:01:45,semicolons  found  in  many  other  languages
00:01:47,python  is  a  multiparadigm  language  we
00:01:49,can  apply  functional  programming
00:01:51,patterns  with  things  like  Anonymous
00:01:52,functions  using  Lambda  it  also  uses
00:01:54,objects  as  an  abstraction  for  data
00:01:56,allowing  you  to  implement  objectoriented
00:01:58,patterns  with  things  like  classes  and
00:02:00,inheritance  it  also  has  a  huge  ecosystem
00:02:03,of  thirdparty  libraries  such  as  deep
00:02:05,learning  Frameworks  like  tensorflow  and
00:02:07,rappers  for  many  high  performance
00:02:08,low-level  packages  like  open  computer
00:02:10,vision  which  are  most  often  installed
00:02:12,with  the  PIP  package  manager  this  has
00:02:14,been  the  Python  programming  language  in
00:02:16,100  seconds  hit  the  like  button  if  you
00:02:18,want  to  see  more  short  videos  like  this
00:02:19,thanks  for  watching  and  I  will  see  you
