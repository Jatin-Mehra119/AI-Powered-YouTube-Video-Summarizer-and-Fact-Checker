0.04,many  years  ago  long  before  most  of  you
2.159,were  conceived  we  lived  in  a  Utopia
4.24,where  if  you  wanted  to  use  software  you
6.04,would  walk  into  a  store  buy  a  box  with  a
8.4,CD  or  floppy  disc  inside  of  it  insert  it
10.84,into  your  computer  and  then  it  was  yours
12.4,to  keep  forever  but  then  one  day  the
14.24,devil  got  a  job  as  a  product  manager  at
16.0,a  software  company  and  had  this  clever
17.88,idea  called  SAS  or  software  as  a  service
20.64,when  you  buy  it  you  don't  actually  own
22.119,it  and  just  rent  it  for  a  monthly  fee
23.8,until  the  day  you  die  this  caused
25.56,profits  to  go  parabolic  and  nowadays
27.519,companies  are  looking  to  squeeze  the
29.0,lemon  even  harder  like  pelaton  is  going
30.96,to  charge  a  $95  reactivation  fee  if  you
33.6,buy  a  used  bike  on  Craigslist  Logitech
35.92,is  looking  to  roll  out  a  pay  as  youo
37.64,Mouse  which  gives  a  new  meaning  to  pay
39.52,per  click  an  adobe  was  recently  sued  by
41.64,the  FTC  for  its  predatory  hidden  early
44.039,termination  fees  the  only  world  that
45.84,doesn't  have  this  problem  is  Temple  OS
47.96,but  the  reality  is  that  nobody  is
49.44,forcing  you  to  buy  these  products  in  a
51.039,free  market  and  the  best  way  to  escape
52.92,subscription  hell  is  to  use  free  and
54.84,open  source  software  Alternatives  that
56.64,these  big  companies  don't  want  you  to
57.96,know  about  before  we  get  into  it  make
59.48,sure  to  draw  and  quarter  that  like
60.96,button  and  put  the  subscription  button's
62.559,head  on  a  pike  it  really  helps  out  the
64.119,channel  aside  from  Windows  itself  which
66.08,can  easily  be  replaced  by  Linux  the  most
68.2,profitable  software  of  all  time  is
69.88,likely  Microsoft  Office  they  get  kids
71.88,hooked  on  it  in  grade  school  so  they  can
73.52,grow  up  to  spin  the  hamster  wheels  that
74.92,churn  out  Microsoft  profits  luckily
76.92,though  there's  a  free  and  open  source
78.439,version  called  Libra  office  which  can  do
80.479,almost  everything  that  word  excel  and
82.24,PowerPoint  do  and  is  compatible  with  a
84.079,crazy  number  of  file  formats  even
85.72,dumpster  fires  like  docx  but  it  is
87.799,missing  some  features  for  Microsoft
89.439,Office  like  it  doesn't  require  an
90.96,internet  connection  to  invade  your
92.32,privacy  it  doesn't  automatically  upload
94.2,your  documents  to  the  cloud  where  they
95.6,can  someday  be  breached  by  hackers  or
97.32,feds  and  it  doesn't  have  a  bunch  of  AI
99.04,garbage  built  into  it  if  you  really  want
100.64,those  features  you  should  continue  to
102.079,pay  Microsoft  but  if  you're  looking  for
103.64,Freedom  Libre  is  the  tool  now  many  teams
105.88,have  escaped  Microsoft  Office  only  to
107.68,land  in  other  paid  tools  like  air  table
109.92,which  itself  is  a  pretty  awesome  tool
111.719,but  extremely  expensive  at  $45  per  month
114.439,per  seat  what's  crazy  though  is  you
116.039,could  likely  support  hundreds  of  users
117.64,on  your  own  VPS  for  just  a  few  dollars
119.479,per  month  by  self-hosting  Nob  it  stores
122.24,data  in  your  favorite  SQL  database  but
124.28,turns  all  the  tables  into  Rich
125.64,spreadsheets  which  is  ideal  for
127.32,collaboration  but  when  your  boss  tells
129.0,you  to  stop  collaborate  and  listen
130.92,You'll  likely  need  to  use  a  note-taking
132.4,app  like  notion  which  is  another  $10  per
134.68,month  once  again  there's  an  open  source
136.36,alternative  called  app  flowy  which  is
138.2,written  in  Rust  and  flutter  not  only  is
140.04,the  UI  beautiful  and  can  do  things  like
141.879,note  taking  con  bonds  and  calendars  but
144.28,noi's  most  recent  Innovation  was  to  shoe
146.319,horn  AI  into  the  platform  well  app  flowy
148.519,can  do  that  too  and  even  let  you  choose
150.28,your  own  llm  provider  that's  pretty
152.28,awesome  but  you  might  be  wondering  how  I
154.0,find  out  about  all  these  amazing  open
155.68,source  tools  one  incredible  resource  is
158.0,daily.  deev  the  sponsor  of  today's  video
160.48,it's  a  website  and  rapidly  growing
162.159,community  that  curates  the  best
163.48,developer  content  on  the  internet  and
165.04,the  app  itself  is  a  free  and  open  source
167.12,project  not  only  will  you  find  the
168.64,hottest  developer  Trends  here  but  you
170.4,can  also  find  tune  your  interest  by
172.04,joining  squads  where  you'll  find  other
173.92,experienced  developers  openly  discussing
175.879,the  tech  you  care  about  the  most  and
177.519,it's  not  just  a  bunch  of  anonymous  Bots
179.319,these  are  real  people  from  the  real
180.72,world  that  you  can  network  with  to  land
182.519,a  job  in  real  life  whether  you're
183.92,learning  to  code  or  just  interested  in
185.56,Tech  daily.  deev  is  a  website  that  every
188.08,developer  should  visit  on  The  Daily  but
189.959,now  it's  time  to  talk  about  another
191.4,massive  software  Juggernaut  called
193.12,Salesforce  they  provide  customer
195.0,relationship  management  software  that
196.72,allows  salespeople  to  strategically
198.36,annoy  you  until  you  buy  something
199.92,there's  a  bunch  of  good  open-  source
201.319,crms  but  one  that  stands  out  is  Erp  next
204.48,which  is  not  only  a  CRM  but  also  an
206.959,enterprise  resource  planning  tool  which
208.799,can  handle  accounting  quality  control
210.879,and  a  bunch  of  other  stuff  it's  written
212.36,in  Python  and  also  maintains  its  own
214.519,custom  web  framework  called  frappe  but
216.56,most  importantly  you  can  run  it  in  2
218.159,minutes  with  Docker  and  cancel  your
219.799,multi-million  dollar  Salesforce
221.319,contracts  now  Salesforce  also  acquired
223.68,the  popular  chat  app  slack  for  27
226.08,billion  yet  another  application  that  you
228.64,really  don't  need  to  be  paying  for  a
230.2,better  option  is  to  use  a  tool  like
231.72,mattermost  which  is  built  with  go  and
233.68,typescript  and  can  be  deployed  as  a
235.36,single  binary  with  a  postgress  database
237.72,not  only  is  it  packed  with  features  for
239.159,chat  but  also  has  integrated  voice  and
241.439,video  chat  it  has  front-end  clients  for
243.36,the  web  iOS  Android  and  desktop  but  most
246.079,importantly  it  gives  you  total  control
247.879,over  your  data  a  company  like  slack
249.76,can't  hold  your  data  hostage  and  demand
251.56,a  ransom  to  get  it  back  but  another
253.28,thing  you  might  be  paying  for  that
254.599,doesn't  even  need  to  store  data  is  zoom
256.799,back  in  the  pandemic  days  I  once  built
258.6,my  own  video  conferencing  app  from
260.04,scratch  with  web  RTC  and  JavaScript  but
262.28,an  even  easier  approach  is  to  use  an
263.88,open  source  tool  like  jitsy  it  uses  web
266.08,RTC  under  the  hood  to  handle  voice
267.72,calling  but  also  provides  a  ton  of  other
269.479,Fe  features  like  mobile  applications
271.639,raised  hands  polls  virtual  backgrounds
274.12,and  everything  else  you  would  expect
275.44,from  a  zoom  alternative  but  if  you're
277.0,unfortunate  enough  to  be  a  professional
278.52,developer  your  scrub  Master  is  likely
280.4,tortured  you  with  a  device  called  jira
282.36,which  forces  you  to  do  Sprints  epics
284.32,burnd  downs  and  tickets  well  the  good
285.96,news  is  that  there's  a  tool  called  plane
288.08,that  makes  this  torture  device  free  and
289.8,open  source  it's  a  torture  device  for
291.72,developers  by  developers  but  if  you're
293.52,developing  something  you  might  be  using
295.16,a  tool  like  Firebase  a  bass  which  stands
297.68,for  big  ass  backend  now  I  like  big  back
300.039,ends  and  I  cannot  lie  but  I  also  don't
302.16,like  paying  for  them  and  being  locked
303.639,into  a  close-  source  platform  nowadays
305.56,there  are  many  great  open  source
306.84,Alternatives  like  convex  aight  super
309.44,base  pocket  base  but  there's  a  newcomer
311.36,you  likely  haven't  heard  of  called
312.72,instant  it's  not  a  full  backend  but  if
314.84,you're  looking  to  build  a  real-time  chat
316.52,or  collaboration  tool  it  handles  the
318.479,client  server  sync  challenges  for  you
320.24,which  is  a  lot  of  work  to  do  correctly
321.56,on  your  own  but  one  thing  that's
322.96,relatively  easy  to  do  on  your  own  is
324.639,host  a  website  yet  many  developers
326.44,choose  to  pay  companies  like  forell  or
328.199,Heroku  a  high  premium  to  do  this  for
330.12,them  you  can  avoid  these  taxes  with
331.6,tools  like  kifi  the  versel  alternative
333.919,or  daku  the  Heroku  alternative  you  can
336.16,use  tools  like  this  to  self-host  all  of
338.12,the  amazing  projects  that  we've  looked
339.56,at  so  far  in  this  video  on  a  single
341.28,virtual  private  server  you  get  the  UI
343.24,and  apis  of  a  premium  hosting  platform
345.68,just  without  the  massive  bills  and  free
347.44,toer  rug  Poes  but  now  we  need  to  talk
349.16,about  perhaps  the  most  greedy  software
350.88,developer  Adobe  I  speak  to  you  as  a
352.88,hypocrite  though  as  I  edit  this  video  in
354.84,Adobe  Premiere  for  which  I  pay  a  $59
357.319,monthly  tribute  as  a  free  human  being
359.12,though  I  could  trade  Adobe  suite  for
360.84,pirated  Adobe  suite  or  better  yet  trade
363.08,premiere  for  Da  Vinci  resolve  and  trade
365.16,illustrator  for  Crea  and  trade  after
367.12,effects  for  blender  virtually  every  SAS
369.16,product  has  a  free  and  open-  Source
370.96,self-hosted  alternative  never  paying  for
373.039,software  again  is  going  to  be  a
374.319,challenge  but  remember  as  developers  we
376.599,don't  do  things  because  they  are  easy  we
378.56,do  them  because  we  thought  they  were
379.88,going  to  be  easy  thanks  for  watching  and
381.72,I  will  see  you  in  the  next  one
